"""Batch job service: background task for async match processing.

Creates its own DB session and LLM client so it is fully independent
of the request lifecycle. Updates the BatchJob row with progress and
per-resume disposition entries as it works.

Retry policy: failed jobs surface their failure to the client. No
auto-retry. The client must resubmit (POST the match again).
run_match_for_resume is idempotent (upserts), so re-running a
completed job is safe.
